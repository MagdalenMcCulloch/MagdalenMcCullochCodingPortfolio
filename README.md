# MagdalenMcCullochCodingPortfolio
this repository includes four projects which display my coding abilities. 

The first, called "linkListPractice.java" provides the user with a short quiz then outputs a personalized order of Rolling Stone's top 500 albums of all time. Based on the quiz, it assigns a value to each album and adds them to a linked list in an ordered fashion. This was a personal project which helped me to become more aquainted with creating and manipulating linked lists.

The second, called "multi_mandelbrot.c" generates an image of the mandelbrot fractal (which you can also find in this repo). I call the fork() function to make use of shared memory so the code runs quickly and uses minimal memory. I designed this program for my Systems Programming class.  

The third, called "mySegmentation.py" segments a text using a unique set of rules I created using the NLTK toolkit. Based on this segmentation, it outputs the number of sentences, words, unique words, and average sentence length of the text. As I learned in my Computational Linguistics class, these figures are useful for digitalizing and translating texts. 

The fourth, called "SenatorsDataVisualization.py" transforms raw data into 2 pie charts which compare race data about the general US population and the US senate. I created this program for my Recent Advancements In Computer Science class. It utilises PANDAS to generate the pie charts which you can find in the file named "SenatorsDataVisualizationOutput.png"

The fifth, called "swat_site.html" creates 3 chart.js graphs to show solar irradiance and horizontal irradiance in Swarthmore PA over the last day, week, and month. I created this site as part of my Senior Thesis Project. You can view the site here: http://fubini.swarthmore.edu/~solarlab/solarlab_graphs.html 
and read my report here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tL662UDWd4Fn_bcTPMg1VwzOklz710BosfRMwwPw_Ek/edit?usp=sharing 

You can find instructions for running each code at the top of their file.
