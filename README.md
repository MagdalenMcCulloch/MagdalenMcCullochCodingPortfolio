# MagdalenMcCullochCodingPortfolio
this repository includes three projects which display my coding abilities. 

The first, called "linkListPractice.java" provides the user with a short quiz then outputs a personalized order of Rolling Stone's top 500 albums of all time. Based on the quiz, it assigns a value to each album and adds them to a linked list in an ordered fashion. This was a personal project which helped me to become more aquainted with creating and manipulating linked lists.

The second, called "multi_mandelbrot.c" generates an image of the mandelbrot fractal (which you can also find in this repo). I call the fork() function to make use of shared memory so the code runs quickly and uses minimal memory. I designed this program for my Systems Programming class.  

The third, called "mySegmentation.py" segments a text using a unique set of rules I created. Based on this segmentation, it outputs the number of sentences, words, unique words, and average sentence length of the text. As I learned in my Computational Linguistics class, these figures are useful for digitalizing and translating texts. 

You can find instructions for running each code at the top of their file.
